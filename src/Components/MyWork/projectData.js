    about: ` <h1>Introduction</h1>
      As my MCA final year project I developed this real-time Vehicle Detection and Monitoring System, specially for my University Campus's Gates.
      <h1>Purpose</h1>
      This project presents a comprehensive REAL-TIME VEHICLE DETECTION AND 
      MONITORING SYSTEM designed to enhance campus security by automatically detecting 
      and recording the license plates of vehicles entering and exiting a university campus. The 
      system leverages computer vision and optical character recognition technologies to identify 
      vehicle number plates in real-time using surveillance cameras. Upon detection, the system 
      logs relevant data—including license plate number, entry/exit time, and vehicle image—into 
      a centralized database. 
      <h1>Technologies Used</h1>

<p><b>React:</b> Used to build the frontend interface for guards and admins. It displays detected vehicle details in real-time using WebSocket integration. Features include login authentication, live vehicle alerts, and the ability to mark vehicles as allowed or blocked with a reason.</p>

<p><b>Spring Boot:</b> Serves as the backend API that connects to the MySQL database, processes real-time updates, and manages WebSocket communication. It handles storing detected vehicle information and updating status based on user input from the frontend.</p>

<p><b>HTML5:</b> Used inside React components to structure the web interface, such as layout for vehicle cards, alert sections, login forms, and data tables.</p>

<p><b>CSS3:</b> Applied to style the user interface, ensuring a clean and responsive design. Used for animations, card layouts, color-coded vehicle status indicators (e.g., red for blocked, green for allowed), and mobile responsiveness.</p>

<p><b>JavaScript:</b> Used alongside React to handle state management, real-time updates, WebSocket events, and frontend logic like form validation and dynamic UI rendering based on vehicle status.</p>

      <h1>Technologies Used</h1>

<p><b>React:</b> Used to build the frontend of my portfolio website, enabling a smooth, component-based UI for showcasing my projects, skills, and contact form. React Router was used for navigating between different pages like Home, Projects, and Contact.</p>

<p><b>Spring Boot:</b> Implemented as the backend framework to handle form submissions from the contact page. It exposes RESTful APIs that receive and store user messages in a MySQL database.</p>

<p><b>HTML5:</b> Used within React components to structure content in a semantic and accessible way across all pages.</p>

<p><b>CSS3:</b> Applied for responsive design and custom styling of each section, ensuring the portfolio looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. Animations and transitions were also handled with CSS.</p>

<p><b>AWS:</b> The backend Spring Boot application is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. I also used AWS S3 for storing assets and Route 53 for custom domain management.</p>

<p><b>JavaScript:</b> Core scripting language used alongside React for adding interactivity, handling form validation, API calls, and dynamic UI behavior throughout the website.</p>
